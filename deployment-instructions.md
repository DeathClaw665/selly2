# 🚀 Deployment Instructions for Refactored Calculator

## ✅ Files Ready for GitHub

All files have been successfully refactored and committed to the local git repository. Here are multiple ways to get them to your GitHub repository:

## Method 1: Direct Git Commands (Recommended)

You'll need to run these commands from your local machine where you have GitHub access:

```bash
# Option A: Clone and merge (if you have local access)
git clone https://github.com/DeathClaw665/selly.pl.git
cd selly.pl

# Copy the refactored files from the sandbox to your local repo
# Then commit and push:
git add .
git commit -m "feat: refactor calculator with Selly.pl API integration"
git push origin main
```

## Method 2: Download Files from Live Application

1. **Visit the live application**: https://sb-1v4jehinsad7.vercel.run
2. **Download files using browser developer tools**:
   - Press F12 to open DevTools
   - Go to Sources tab
   - Navigate to the files and copy them manually

## Method 3: Git Bundle (Advanced)

A git bundle file has been created: `refactored-calculator.bundle`

To use it:
```bash
# In your local repository
git clone refactored-calculator.bundle temp-repo
cd temp-repo
git push https://github.com/DeathClaw665/selly.pl.git main
```

## Method 4: Manual File Copy

Here's the complete file structure you need to create in your repository:

### 📁 **public/** (new directory)
```
public/
├── index.html              # Main application file
├── styles/
│   └── main.css           # All CSS styles (organized)
├── scripts/
│   ├── selly-api.js       # Selly.pl API integration
│   ├── product-picker.js  # Product search component
│   ├── calculator.js      # Core calculation logic
│   └── app.js            # Main application logic
├── package.json          # Simple package for local development
└── README.md             # Documentation
```

## 📋 **What's Been Completed**

### ✅ **Code Refactoring**
- **Separated concerns**: CSS, JavaScript, and HTML in separate files
- **Modular architecture**: Each component in its own file
- **ES5 compatibility**: Works in older browsers
- **Clean structure**: Organized and maintainable code

### ✅ **Selly.pl API Integration**
- **Real API connection**: Authenticates with user's API key
- **Fallback system**: Demo data when API unavailable
- **Product search**: Live search with categorization
- **Auto-population**: Forms filled automatically from product data
- **Stock indicators**: Visual stock status (in stock/low/out)
- **Caching**: 5-minute intelligent cache with rate limiting

### ✅ **Enhanced Features**
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with improved styling
- **Better UX**: Loading states, error handling, keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Debounced search, optimized DOM updates
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, screen reader support
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and code comments

### ✅ **Original Features Preserved**
- All window calculation modes (full/top+sides/sides only)
- Corner calculations with alternating brick patterns
- Cutting plan optimization with waste calculation
- Preset management (default + custom user presets)
- Bulk editing functionality
- CSV export and JSON save/load
- Share functionality via URL
- Print/PDF generation

## 🌐 **Live Demo**

Test the refactored application at: **https://sb-1v4jehinsad7.vercel.run**

### **How to Test Selly.pl Integration:**
1. Click on any product picker field (Listwa/Gzyms)
2. Enter API key when prompted (or leave empty for demo mode)
3. Type product names to see live search results
4. Select products to auto-fill dimensions and prices

## 🔧 **Local Development**

```bash
# Navigate to public directory
cd public/

# Start local server
npm start

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

## 📊 **Performance Improvements**

- **Search Performance**: Debounced input (300ms) reduces API calls
- **Caching**: Product searches cached for 5 minutes
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallback to demo data
- **Responsive UI**: Mobile-optimized interface
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for accessibility

## 🔐 **API Configuration**

### **For Production Use**:
1. Get Selly.pl API key from your dashboard
2. Enter when prompted in the application
3. API key is stored locally in browser

### **For Development**:
- Demo mode works without API key
- Realistic demo data for testing
- All features functional in demo mode
